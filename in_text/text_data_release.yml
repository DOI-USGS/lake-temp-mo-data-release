  Predictions of lake water temperatures for eight reservoirs in Missouri US, 1980-2021


abstract: >-
  Lake temperature is an important environmental metric for understanding 
  habitat suitability for many freshwater species and is especially useful
  when temperatures are predicted throughout the water column (known as
  temperature profiles). This dataset provides estimates of water temperature
  at half meter depths for eight reservoirs in Missouri, USA using version 3 
  of the General Lake Model (Hipsey et al. 2019). The reservoirs are: Bull Shoals Lake,
  Lake Ozark, Lake Stockton, Mark Twain Lake, Pomme De Terre Lake, Table Rock Lake,
  Truman Reservoir, and Wapapello Lake.
  
  Both calibrated and uncalibrated model configurations (see 'GLM_{cal|uncal}_nml.zip' 
  files), as well as, predicted temperatures (see 'GLM_{cal|uncal}_profile_results.zip' files) 
  for each of the eight reservoirs are included. In addition, the spatial, 
  observational, and climatic driver datasets ('study_lakes.zip', 'temperature_obs.zip', 
  and 'NLDAS_GLM_csv.zip', respectively) required to run the models are available. 
  Lastly, a crosswalk between the reservoir names, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution">USGS National Hydrography 
  Dataset High Resolution (NHDHR)</a> permanent identification codes (Prmnn_I), and identifiers defined by
  the University of Missouri is provided (see the 'mo_nhdhr_xwalk.csv' file).
  
  This research was funded by the Midwest Climate Adaptation Science Center (MW CASC).

process-description: >-
  The data aggregation methods used to parameterize the uncalibrated models and 
  to assemble the temperature profile data are described in Willard et al. 2022. 
  This data release used these methods to aggregate additional cooperator data 
  for the eight reservoirs of interest. This data release also used full 
  temperature profiles for each sampling date rather than onyl using surface 
  temperatures.

  Model calibration was acheived using a three parameter optimization process 
  described in Read et al. 2019 and optimizing the following three parameters: 
  the bulk aerodynamic transfer coefficient for momentum (cd), the scaling factor 
  to adjust the shortwave radiation data (sw_factor), and the light extinction 
  coefficient(Kw). 
  
  The computing platform for generating data and metadata was 
  x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) and R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10).
  
  This dataset was generated using open source tools available in the R 
  programming language (R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10)). R packages loaded into
