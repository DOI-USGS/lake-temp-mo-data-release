  Data release: Predictions of lake water temperatures for eight reservoirs in Missouri US, 1980-2021


abstract: >-
  This dataset provides model specifications used to estimate water temperature from the process-based model, 
  General Lake Model verion 3 (Hipsey et al. 2019) using calibrated model configurations and uncalibrated model 
  configurations for 8 reservoirs in Missouri, USA.
